                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp;Peris Rai.</strong>
                <br />A passionate programmer and a Coach, born and brought up
                in India. I am a Full Stack Web Developer with React.js, Redux,
                Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL as my tech stack.
                <br />
                In 2019, I successfully completed my Engineering with
                specialization in 'Electronics and Telecommunication'.
                <br />
                Working with the clients, my goal is always driven towards
                providing amazing experience with the best level of quality and
                service to them.
                <br />
                Along with that, I also help people as a COACH on their journey
                of becoming a professional programmer.
                <br />I love learning about new technologies, what problems are
                they solving and How can I use them to build better and scalable
                products.
